# Welcome!

This is the pattern library for MLTSHP.

## Design Review

If you're here to test the new Dark Mode, I recommend you look at the [Permalink Page](/?path=/docs/legacy-areas-permalink--permalink). You can toggle the dark mode in your operating system, or by using the little "moon" icon in the toolbar.

## Package Managers

Pull in MLTSHP's pattern library files into nearly any project with a package manager.

The package includes both the compiled code and the source files. So you can either include the compiled CSS, or load the source files directly. If you use the source files, you'll need to compile them yourself, using Sass and Autoprefixer.
