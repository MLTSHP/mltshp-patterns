# Welcome!

This is the pattern library for MLTSHP.

## Package Managers

Pull in MLTSHP's pattern library files into nearly any project with a package manager.

The package includes both the compiled code and the source files. So you can either include the compiled CSS and JS, or load the source files directly. If you use the source files, you'll need to compile them yourself. For the CSS files, you'll need to use Sass and Autoprefixer.

### npm

Install in your Node.js powered apps with [the npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mltshp-patterns):

```
npm install mltshp-patterns
```

### yarn

Install in your Node.js powered apps with [the yarn package](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/mltshp-patterns):
