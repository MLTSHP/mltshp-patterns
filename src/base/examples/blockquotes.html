  Let’s keep it simple. Italics are good to help set it off from the body text.
  Be sure to style the citation.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am a HAL 9000 computer. I became operational at
    the H.A.L. plant in Urbana, Illinois on the 12th of January 1992. My
    instructor was Mr. Langley, and he taught me to sing a song. If you’d like
    to hear it I can sing it for you.
