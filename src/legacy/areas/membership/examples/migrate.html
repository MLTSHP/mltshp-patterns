      <h2>Restore Your MLKSHK Content?</h2>

      <p>
        Would you like to restore your content from MLKSHK.com or start over
        with a clean account? If you choose to restore, all your posts, shakes,
        and comments will be brought over (with the same IDs, exactly as on
        MLKSHK).
      </p>

      <p>
        Posts you have favorited may not all be restored, since those are owned
        by others; once those members restore their content, you’ll see them
        again.
      </p>

      <p>
        You’ll have until <strong>December 31st, 2017</strong> to choose to
        restore your content. After that time, we will need to remove it
        permanently.
      </p>
