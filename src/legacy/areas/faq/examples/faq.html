    <h2>What is going on here?</h2>
    <p>
      MLTSHP is an approximate clone of the much-loved site MLKSHK created by
      Andre and Amber which <a href="#">closed in April of 2017</a>. We are 100%
      community funded and member-run. The site is subscription-based and is a
      registered corporation. <a href="#">The code is on Github</a> along with
      <a href="#">a welcome module there</a> which talks about what is going on.
      There is also a Slack (email <a href="#">hello@mltshp.com</a> for an
      invite!) and <a href="#">a Facebook group</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>What do the membership levels mean?</h2>
    <p>
      Membership is required to participate on MLTSHP, but it‘s a low bar! We‘d
      love to have you aboard! These are the options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Non-members can see the Popular page and individual posts.</li>
      <li>
        The Single Scoop level ($3 per year) is a great way to check out the
        site. Members can:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Post images and videos to their own shakes and to group shakes, up
            to a monthly upload limit of 300MB for images and animated GIFs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Follow their friends‘ shakes, and follow and join group shakes.
          </li>
          <li>Save, like, and comment on any posts.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        The Double Scoop level ($24 per year) can do all of the above, plus:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>There are no fixed upload limits.</strong></li>
          <li>Make up to 100 of their own group shakes.</li>
          <li>Get a little plus sign next to their name.</li>
          <li>Have RSS feeds for their shakes.</li>
        </ul>
        Even at just $2 per month, Double Scoop members cover the primary
        expenses of running MLTSHP and help make the Single Scoop level
        possible.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We ran some numbers and determined that with our current membership, we
      could run the site if most users contributed $2/month. This includes
      things like paying for storage, hosting, bandwidth, a business license,
      someone to do our taxes and answer the odd legal question we may have to
      ask. We added a “bare bones” membership because we don‘t want anyone to be
      excluded.
