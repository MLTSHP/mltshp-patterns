# Bookmark

Appears on shake pages, tracking the user's reading progress.

Note that the bookmark is intended to "pull" slightly outside the content well. These samples have some padding adding to keep it visible.

## Default

<Canvas>
  <Story of={BookmarkStories.Default} />
</Canvas>

## Jump Link

The bookmark can include an optional jump link to let the user return to the original position.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={BookmarkStories.JumpLink} />
</Canvas>
