# User Counts

Appears in the sidebar on User Shakes.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="User Counts" height="100px">
    {() => userCountsMarkup}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Narrow

Though fully responsive, this component is typically displayed in the sidebar with a constrained width. Care should be taken, since very large numbers can appear in this component.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Narrow" height="100px">
    {() => userCountsNarrowMarkup}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
