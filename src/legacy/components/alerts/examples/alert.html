  <strong>Attention!</strong>
  This is a BETA version of MLTSHP. Anything you do here will be wiped before
  launch. Please kick the tires, and report any issues in the
  <a href="#">bug list</a>. You can also join the #beta-testers channel on the
  <a href="#">MLTSHP</a> slack. You canâ€™t import your MLKSHK yet, but all other
  MLKSHK functionality should be working.
