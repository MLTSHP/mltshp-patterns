## User Counts

Appears in the sidebar on User Shakes.

{% include 'styleguide-example', html: '/src/components/user-counts/examples/user-counts.html' %}

## Narrow

Though fully responsive, this component is typically displayed in the sidebar
with a constrained width. Care should be taken, since very large numbers can
appear in this component.

{% include 'styleguide-example', html: '/src/components/user-counts/examples/user-counts-narrow.html' %}
