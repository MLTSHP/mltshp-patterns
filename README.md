> Pattern Library for MLTSHP Apps

Welcome to the Pattern Library repository! The intent is that any MLTSHP app should be able to consume the Pattern Library package to quickly inherit the MLTSHP look and feel. This package is being used on the main MLTSHP site, so we're eating our own dogfood here.

Contributions are welcome! Please see the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Installation

Pull in MLTSHP's pattern library files into nearly any project with a package manager.

The package includes both the compiled code and the source files. So you can either include the compiled CSS, or load the source files directly. If you use the source files, you'll need to compile them yourself, using Sass and Autoprefixer.

Install in your Node.js powered apps using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mltshp-patterns) or [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/mltshp-patterns):

```
npm install mltshp-patterns
```

```
yarn add mltshp-patterns
```
